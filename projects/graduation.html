                        <p class="description">The project explores the link between contemporary consumerism, climate change, and the need to rethink sustainable development models. It highlights the importance of a circular and bio-based economy, as well as the cultural responsibility in promoting ecological change.
                        Set design, as a highly productive and impactful sector, is called to reconsider its practices through the use of ecological and biodegradable materials. The proposed project analyzes the life cycle of sets, proposes innovative solutions for sustainability, and experiments with new materials, culminating in a green exhibition that demonstrates the possibility of eco-sustainable set production.                          
                        The research highlights how the cultural industry can play a crucial role in the ecological transition by embracing new practices and methodologies.</p>

                      <p class="description">“Materia viva” is an exhibition focused on experimentation and the development of new artistic ideas. It represents an empirical exploration aimed at discovering new materials for creating art that addresses the challenges of today’s world.
                        <br />The works on display stem from the need to confront one of the most pressing issues facing contemporary society: climate change.                      
                        <br />The causes of global warming and CO2 emissions are primarily the result of human activity, and solutions to these problems require new, sustainable approaches. Just as science and politics must mobilize to address the impact of these dynamics on our planet, art—as a reflection of human culture and a medium for conveying emotions and messages—also bears a responsibility to adapt its language in support of activism for environmental preservation.                      
                       Historically, the choice of materials has always been a crucial step in the creation and conception of art. It affects not only the realization of the work but also its reception by the public. <br />Materials, as the primary medium used in visual art, has undergone significant conceptual and methodological transformations, particularly since the second half of the 20th century. These changes have been driven by various motivations, from exploring the aesthetic qualities of materials to the symbolic meanings attributed to them, and by the artist’s desire to highlight political or social critique.                      
                       <br />Contemporary art that engages with issues like pollution and the environmental changes our planet has undergone requires a coherent and appropriate language. In this context, the choice of materials becomes the starting point for experimentation aimed at developing eco-sustainable artistic practices.                      
                       <br />To be considered "ecological" or "sustainable," a material’s entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal, as well as its role in the construction process, must meet the highest environmental and social standards. In other words, it should have minimal impact and cause no harm to health or the environment.                     
                       <br />Introducing these materials into visual art presents both a complex challenge and an exciting opportunity for those who advocate for the growth of ecological art. 
                       This exhibition features the works of emerging young artists who have contributed to the exploration of alternative, sustainable, and ecological materials. These artists position themselves as pioneers of an art that does not aim to be an idealistic or utopian experience, but rather a practice grounded in the values it seeks to communicate. The sculptures, paintings, and photographs on display are the result of thorough research and creative work by the artists in a field that remains largely unexplored. Their work is an ongoing, passionate investigation, always in progress.
                       The art exhibited here is, therefore, living art— live matter. It is organic, natural, contemporary, energetic, and activist.

                      <p class="description">“Materia viva” was conceived as an event that merges experimentation, sustainability, and art. The exhibition presents itself as an entirely     ecological event, with the goal of demonstrating how art can be created using green materials.
                      This vision led to the decision to design the exhibition using materials that are environmentally friendly and can be easily disposed of without causing pollution at the end of the event. <br />The design of the spaces, created in collaboration with colleague Sabrina Deiana, was initially based on the materials chosen for their sustainability, budget considerations, and the specific limitations of the exhibition rooms.
                        
                      Next, the design of the various structures to display the works of eight artists took shape. Palazzo Senarega, the venue for the event, presented certain challenges, particularly the inability to drill into the walls or hang objects. This led to the creation of seven self-supporting stands to display the works (the eighth piece, "Black Out" by Jessica Sergi, was designed to be placed on the floor).
                        
                      The materials selected for the exhibition's construction were:<br />
                      <br />
                      • Italian bamboo, sourced from a bamboo grove and derived from waste materials from a condominium land reclamation;<br />
                      <br />
                      • Twine, used to bind the bamboo canes into frames that could support the artworks;<br />
                      <br />
                      • River stones, serving as bases to support the bamboo frames, left unprocessed so they can be returned to the location from which they were sourced after the event;<br />
                      <br />
                      • Recycled fishing line from the Recycline brand, made from regenerated nylon derived from fishing industry waste such as nets and old lines, recovered directly from the oceans;<br />
                      <br />
                      • Bioplastic made from sodium alginate and coffee, used to display the work "Che cosa porterai? Quattro fotografie blu" by Gabriele Teodosio;<br />
                      <br />
                      • Bioplastic made from methylcellulose, mounted on a bamboo support and used as a diffuser for the slides in the work "Diapositive vegetali" by Riccardo Bonetti;<br />
                      <br />
                      • 8mm iron rods for reinforcement, inserted into hollow stones and fitted into the bases of the bamboo canes, which were also hollowed out.<br />
                      <br />
