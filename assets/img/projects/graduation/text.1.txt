“Materia viva” is an exhibition focused on experimentation and the development of new artistic ideas. It represents an empirical exploration aimed at discovering new materials for creating art that addresses the challenges of today’s world.

The works on display stem from the need to confront one of the most pressing issues facing contemporary society: climate change.

The causes of global warming and CO2 emissions are primarily the result of human activity, and solutions to these problems require new, sustainable approaches. Just as science and politics must mobilize to address the impact these dynamics have on our planet, art— as a reflection of human culture and a means of conveying emotions and messages— also has a responsibility to adapt its language to support activism for environmental preservation.

Historically, the choice of materials has always been a crucial step in the creation and conception of art. It affects not only the realization of the work but also its reception by the public. Matter, as the primary medium used in visual art, has undergone significant conceptual and methodological transformations, particularly since the second half of the 20th century. These changes have been driven by various motivations, from exploring the aesthetic qualities of materials to the symbolic meanings attributed to them, and by the artist’s desire to highlight political or social critique.

Contemporary art that engages with issues like pollution and the environmental changes our planet has undergone requires a coherent and appropriate language. In this context, the choice of materials becomes the starting point for experimentation aimed at developing eco-sustainable artistic practices.

To be considered "ecological" or "sustainable," a material’s entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal, as well as its role in the construction process, must meet the highest environmental and social standards. In other words, it should have minimal impact and cause no harm to health or the environment.

Introducing these materials into visual art presents both a complex challenge and an exciting opportunity for those who advocate for the growth of ecological art. 
This exhibition features the works of emerging young artists who have contributed to the exploration of alternative, sustainable, and ecological materials. These artists position themselves as pioneers of an art that does not aim to be an idealistic or utopian experience, but rather a practice grounded in the values it seeks to communicate.

The sculptures, paintings, and photographs on display are the result of thorough research and creative work by the artists in a field that remains largely unexplored. Their work is an ongoing, passionate investigation, always in progress.

The art exhibited here is, therefore, living art— live matter. It is organic, natural, contemporary, energetic, and activist.
