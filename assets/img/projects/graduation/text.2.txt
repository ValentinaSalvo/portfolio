“Materia viva” was conceived as an event that merges experimentation, sustainability, and art. The exhibition presents itself as an entirely ecological event, with the goal of demonstrating how art can be created using green materials.

This vision led to the decision to design the exhibition using materials that are environmentally friendly and can be easily disposed of without causing pollution at the end of the event. The design of the spaces, created in collaboration with colleague Sabrina Deiana, was initially based on the materials chosen for their sustainability, budget considerations, and the specific limitations of the exhibition rooms.

Next, the design of the various structures to display the works of eight artists took shape. Palazzo Senarega, the venue for the event, presented certain challenges, particularly the inability to drill into the walls or hang objects. This led to the creation of seven self-supporting stands to display the works (the eighth piece, "Black Out" by Jessica Sergi, was designed to be placed on the floor).

The materials selected for the exhibition's construction were:

• Italian bamboo, sourced from a bamboo grove and derived from waste materials from a condominium land reclamation;

• Twine, used to bind the bamboo canes into frames that could support the artworks;

• River stones, serving as bases to support the bamboo frames, left unprocessed so they can be returned to the location from which they were sourced after the event;

• Recycled fishing line from the Recycline brand, made from regenerated nylon derived from fishing industry waste such as nets and old lines, recovered directly from the oceans;

• Bioplastic made from sodium alginate and coffee, used to display the work "Che cosa porterai? Quattro fotografie blu" by Gabriele Teodosio;

• Bioplastic made from methylcellulose, mounted on a bamboo support and used as a diffuser for the slides in the work "Diapositive vegetali" by Riccardo Bonetti;

• 8mm iron rods for reinforcement, inserted into hollow stones and fitted into the bases of the bamboo canes, which were also hollowed out.
