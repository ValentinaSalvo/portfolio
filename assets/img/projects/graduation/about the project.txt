The project explores the link between contemporary consumerism, climate change, and the need to rethink sustainable development models. It highlights the importance of a circular and bio-based economy, as well as the cultural responsibility in promoting ecological change.

Set design, as a highly productive and impactful sector, is called to reconsider its practices through the use of ecological and biodegradable materials. The proposed project analyzes the life cycle of sets, proposes innovative solutions for sustainability, and experiments with new materials, culminating in a green exhibition that demonstrates the possibility of eco-sustainable set production.

The research highlights how the cultural industry can play a crucial role in the ecological transition by embracing new practices and methodologies.
